      <h1>WHY ARE NATIVE PLANTS IMPORTANT?</h1>
<br></br>
      <p4> 
As climate change becomes more and more of a threat, native plants become more and more important. 
Our native plants provide essential ecosystem services and have specifically evolved to deal with 
an areasâ€™ microclimatic conditions. Species evolve alongside each other in communities, and their 
successful function relies on all the other species. By planting native, you not only gain aesthetic improvement, 
but help out all the other organisms that your area calls home. Learn more about Native Plants from the National Audobon Society

<h1>WHATS THE DEAL WITH INVASIVE AND NOXIOUS SPECIES?</h1>
<br></br>
<p5>While noxious species may be native, they can be harmful to the wellbeing of humans and other animals,
  and for that reason, any plantings should be done after consulting with local arborists or ecologists to 
  ensure your safety. Invasive species might not be directly harmful to you, but can do damage to the ecosystem 
  and lead to environmental degradation over time. While some invasive species may be beautiful, their impacts 
  on our communities are not. Learn more about invasive and noxious species from the Bureau of Land Management
